# Challenge 12 - Employee Tracker

## Project Purpose

The command line interface of an employee database that holds department, role, and employee data.

## App Built With

- JavaScript ES6 / ES2015
- Node.js
- npm
- MySQL
- MySQL2 (npm package)
- Inquirer (npm package)
- console.table (npm package)

## Usage

Type "npm i" to install packages and dependencies, then type "node index" to begin the app. Users are presented with a menu of choices, which can be selected using UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW keys and then choosing ENTER/RETURN. Display only options ("View All Departments", "View All Roles", and "View All Employees") will automatically return a table of information for the selected option as contained in the database. Options that require user input will be presented as such, and then the requested output will be displayed as a table, or a confirmation of the database response will be shown.
